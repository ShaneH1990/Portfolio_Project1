        <ul>
            <li><p>The Lines havent eroded yet despite thee long time they have  been present in the Peruvian Desert this is because the sub-layer of the lines contains high amounts of lime and with moisture forming on it from ther morning mist this helps it to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds and so the lines remain in place.</p></li>
            <li><p> An American historian named Paul Kosok, is credited as being the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines in detail. While he was in Peru between 1940 and 1941 studying ancient irrigation systems, when he flew over the Nazca lines he noticed that one was in the shape of a bird after Another observation of them he was able to see how  the lines converged on the horizon at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. He then began to study how the lines might have initially been made and what their purpose was with the help of two archaeologists, Richard P. Schaedel from the USA, and Maria Reiche from Germany,They hypothesized that the figures were designed as astronomical markers to show where the sun and other celestial bodies would rise on significant dates.</p></li>

            <p class="paragraph">the Nazca lines are believed to be created between 500BC and 500AD and during this time there was consider to be 2 phases of the Nazca lines</p>
            <ol id="organised">
                <li>Paracas Phase: believed to spaning from 400-200BC</li>
                <li>Nazca Phase: second phase of constructed lines in 200BC- 500AD</li>
            </ol>

    <h2 id ="factsh2">The Paracas Phase</h2>
    <p>The paracas phase was during a period in time when an Andean society existing between approximately 800 BCE and 100 BCE,a society that had extensive knowledge of irrigation and water management and that made significant contributions in the textile arts. Most information about the lives of the Paracas people comes from excavations at the large seaside Paracas site on the Paracas Peninsula, are it was investigated in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello.</p>
    <h2 id="factsh2">The Nazca Phase</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">between 80-100 new figures have been found in recent years as close as 2020 through the use of drones,

        this new figures are found to be designed in the shape of animals and plants such as  trees flowers
        and as of 2020 a cat design was found on a hilltop with archaeologists believing there may be many more yet to be discovered
