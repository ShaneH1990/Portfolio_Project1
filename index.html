        <p class="p1">In southern Peru a group of geoglyphs depicting animals,trees and plants were discovered in the soil of the Nazca desert these geoglyphs are believed to have been created some time between 500 BC -500 AD and are often referred to as the Nazca Lines of Peru.Individual Nazca designs have been measured to span somewhere between 400 and 1,100 metres across with a combined length of the lines being around 1,300kms.

        <h2>What Was The Purpose Of The Nazca Lines?</h2>
        <p class="p2">Some Believe the Purpose of the Lines was for them to be seen by gods or deities in the sky while other believed it was for astrological reasons.
                        Another Theory is that some straight lines may have been used to track the changing declinations of the three stars of Orion's Belt.
