    <h2>Theories surrounding the mystery of the Nazca Lines</h2>

    <section id="mysterygrid">
        <p id="m1">A Swedish writer, who also happened to be fascinated by UFO and also extraterrestrial visitations wrote abbout his beliefs surrounding archeology sites such as the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge, and Easter Island, and how to him they may have been connected in some way to extraterrestrials.The swedish writer,Erich von Daniken, would often suggest that the origins of religions are formed from the reactions of ancient people when they came in contact with an exterrestial being or some form of alien race.In 1968 Von Daniken went onto published his best-selling book titled "Chariots of the Gods?". In this book he proposes a theory that the mysterious Nazca lines may have actually been used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized that the design of the lines were made by aliens and may have been created to help steer or navigate their spaceships.The writer also claimed that the line patterns at the site looked similar to a modern airport runway and used this as evidence to support his theory that aliens used the area as a landing strip for their spaceships.According to Von Daniken there is an interesting story in Sanskrit literature that describes an aircraft landed on Earth, and the local people gathered around and watched in amazement as "human-like beings with golden, shimmering skins" would leave there ship to mined for metals and then they would fly away in their ship after this these ancient astronauts apparantly returned to built landing tracks and when completed they left again never to return. The people would then build more runways and figures in the hope that these beings whom they may as perceived as gods would once again return. Another one of Erich von Daniken's theories about the Naza was that figures, which he assumed to be astronauts, that were found on Nazca clay vessels, were "flying gods" that were visiting from other worlds. He quickly trashes and rebukes scientists who have studied Nazca; their research using radiocarbon tests to date the figures, their analyses of ceramic shads at the various sites, and also their careful dissections of Native American religious beliefs.
                        At the time[45] of Erich von Daniken's publishing of "Chariots of the Gods?", scientists and archeologist such as Maria Reiche declared that his ideas were absurd and should be discarded. These scientists and archeologists also were able to prove that these lines could have been made using simple tools that would have been available to the people at the time they were created. Erich von Daniken's books "Arrival of the Gods" and "Chariots of the Gods?" were considered to not have intellectual credibility or literary merit at all. Before Von Daniken's work, other authors had presented ideas of extraterrestrial contact with ancient humans, but he failed to credit these authors, even when making the same claims and also using identical or similar evidence. Nevertheless, Von Daniken's books drew in thousands of visitors and believers to the site.
                        There is still a mystery behind the reason why the Nazca lines were created and it is likely that the precise meaning of this mysterious site will probably always elude us. Some think they were drawn for astronomical[46] purposes while others think the lines were used for water-related religious ceremonies. This site likely forged close ties between humans living on earth and the spiritual worlds that most Native American religions have.
