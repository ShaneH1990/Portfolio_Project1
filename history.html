        <p id="paragraph1">The Nazca Lines are believed to have been created some time between 500 BC and 500 AD with the first mention of the Nazca Lines being in 1553 by Pedro Cieza de León who published a book where he would refer to them as "trail markers" and although at the time the lines were partially visible from nearby hills, the peruvian army and civilian pilots were the first to report them in the 20th century. In 1927 a Peruvian archaeologist named Toribio Mejía Xesspe spotted them while he was out hiking through the foothills.</p>
        <p id="paragraph2">In early 2011 two new figures were discovered by a Japanese team from the Yamagata University.One of the figures resembled a human head and has been dated to the early period of Nazca culture,While the other is a figure of an animal and is undated.by 2012 the japanese team has found an estimated 100 new geoglyphs.In March 2012, the university announced it would be opening a new research center.If you would like to learn more be sure to check out the facts webpage and the conspiracy page if your interested in theories surrounding the Nazca lines!
